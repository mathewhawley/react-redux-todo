[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mathewhawley/react-redux-todo.svg?token=cfmqWCypBNFkZssyeoWG&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mathewhawley/react-redux-todo)

This is a simple, classic 'to do' application that has been built as a learning exercise – to act as an introduction to various technologies and practices that I am keen to explore and potentially work more with going forward.

## Set up
Currently, this build is only configured for a development environment. Future steps will look to add a production build and server-side rendering.

To run this application, please make sure you are using at least `v5.0.0` of **Node.js**.

Once you have cloned the repository, simply run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
