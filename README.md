## Set up
Currently, this build is only configured for a development environment. Future steps will look to add a production build and server-side rendering.

To run this application, please make sure you are using at least `v5.0.0` of **Node.js**.

Once you have cloned the repository, simply run:

```
$ npm install

```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
